# DemoIMU
this demo show what's the motion sensors different between Pilot SDK and Android SDK

## Sensor coordinate system different
you can find [android sensor coordinate system](https://developer.android.google.cn/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview#sensors-coords) here, if you understand android sensor coordinate system, you can understand pilot sensor coordinate system easily. X axis in android is Y axis in pilot, Y axis in android is X axis in pilot, Z axis in android and pilot is the same.
